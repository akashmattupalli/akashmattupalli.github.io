**Technical skills:** CAD (Solidworks), CAM (Fusion 360), CNC Milling

Purdue Electric Racing (PER) is an engineering student organization that tries to design, build and race an electric racing car. I joined PER's Vehicle Dynamics Subteam during my freshman year and I started to learn how to CAD and CAM in Solidworks and Fusion 360. One of my main projects was to manufacture upright brackets for the wheel hub assemblies using a 5 Axis Mill.
