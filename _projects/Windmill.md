As part of the design project in _ME 354: Machine Design_, we had to build a reverse wind turbine that used a gear ratio to scale down the motor's angular velocity to make the fan spin as slow as possible. The specifications were: 

* All components must fit within an 8" x 8" x 8" cube
* All gears have to be 3/8" at maximum
* The design must be self-supported
* Teams are expected to make design and manufacture the gears, shafts, gearbox and turbine blades

In the end, with a gear ratio of 1/1536, we were able to scale down the motor's 15,000 rpm to the fan's 9.8 rpm. Our final report can be found below.
