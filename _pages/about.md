Hi! My name is Akash and I recently graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Mechanical Engineering from Purdue University. I have conducted research in engineering education, computational analysis applications in fluids, and reverse osmosis. I have also worked as a controls engineering intern at Remora, a carbon capture start-up in Michigan. I will be working as an Equipment Engineer at TSMC in Phoenix, Arizona.

My values in engineering are rooted in human-centered design, with special interests in **control systems, mechatronics** and **simulation programs**. 

My perspectives in engineering derive from my intercultural experiences of living in India, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, United Kingdom, United States, and Spain. 

I also love to read and to write in my free time. I have written poems, short stories, and essays, some of which are published on print or online.
