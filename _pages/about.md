Hi! My name is Akash and I am currently a senior in Mechanical Engineering at Purdue University. I have conducted research in engineering education and computational fluid dynamics, and worked as a controls engineering intern at Remora, a carbon capture start-up in Michigan. 

My values in engineering are rooted in human-centered design, with special interests in **control systems, mechatronics** and **simulation programs**. 

My perspectives in engineering derive from my intercultural experiences of living in India :india:, Saudi Arabia :saudi_arabia:, Singapore :singapore:, United Kingdom :uk:, United States :us:, and Spain :es:. 

I also love to read and to write in my free time. I have written poems, short stories, and essays, some of which are published on print or online.
